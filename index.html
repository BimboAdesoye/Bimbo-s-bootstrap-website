                <p class="fw-bold">
                  Jaguars, also known as Panthera onca, are large and powerful
                  carnivorous animals native to the Americas. They are the third
                  largest big cat in the world and are the largest cat in the
                  Americas. Jaguars have a distinctive appearance, with their
                  golden-yellow fur covered in dark spots, known as rosettes.
                  These spots help to camouflage them in their forested
                  habitats. They have a muscular build and are known for their
                  powerful bite, which is strong enough to pierce the thick hide
                  of their prey.

                <p class="fw-bold">
                  Tigers are majestic and powerful creatures that belong to the
                  cat family, Felidae. They are easily recognizable by their
                  distinctive orange coat with black stripes, white belly, and
                  long, muscular body. They are the largest members of the cat
                  family, with males weighing up to 600 pounds and reaching up
                  to 10 feet in length, including the tail. Females are slightly
                  smaller, weighing up to 400 pounds and reaching up to 9 feet
                  in length. Tigers are found primarily in Asia, from the
                  forests of India and Nepal to the rainforests of Southeast
                  Asia and the Russian Far East. There are six subspecies of
                  tigers: Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan, Siberian, South China,
                  and Sumatran. Unfortunately, all of these subspecies are
                  considered endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. Tigers
                  are solitary animals and are known for their hunting prowess.
                  They are apex predators and can take down prey much larger
                  than themselves, such as water buffalo and deer. Tigers are
                  also excellent swimmers and are one of the few species of big
                  cats that enjoy swimming.

                <p class="fw-bold">
                  Snow leopards, also known as "ghosts of the mountains," are
                  one of the most elusive and endangered big cats in the world.
                  They are native to the high mountain ranges of Central Asia,
                  including the Himalayas, Altai Mountains, and the Tibetan
                  Plateau. These majestic creatures are known for their stunning
                  grey-white fur, which helps them blend in with their rocky
                  surroundings. Their thick, furry tails act as a counterbalance
                  when they are jumping or climbing, while their large, wide
                  paws help them to move easily through the snow. Snow leopards
                  are solitary animals, and they are most active at dawn and
                  dusk. They are ambush predators, preying on a variety of
                  animals including blue sheep, ibex, and marmots. They have
                  also been known to hunt domestic livestock, which has put them
                  in conflict with local herders.

              Yes, many species of big cats are endangered. According to the
              International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List,
              several species of big cats, including the tiger, lion, leopard,
              and cheetah, are listed as either endangered or vulnerable.
              Habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict are some of
              the main reasons for their decline in numbers. Additionally, the
              illegal trade in big cat parts, such as skins and bones, is a
              significant threat to their survival. Conservation efforts are
              underway to protect these magnificent animals, including habitat
              protection, anti-poaching efforts, and captive breeding programs.

              consider the cougar (also known as the puma or mountain lion) to
              be a big cat, which would make six species in total. All of these

              Big cats are a group of large predatory felines that are found in
              various parts of the world. They are called "big" because of their
              size, strength, and hunting abilities compared to other cats. The
              term "big cat" generally refers to the five members of the
              Panthera genus: lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, and snow
              leopards. These cats are distinguished from other felines by their
              ability to roar (due to a special bone in their throats), their
              size, and their hunting abilities. Generally, a big cat is
              considered to be any feline that weighs over 50 kilograms (110
              pounds). Lions and tigers are the largest of the big cats, with
              adult males weighing up to 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) in the
              case of some Siberian tigers. Leopards and jaguars are slightly
              smaller, with adult males weighing up to 90 kilograms (200
              pounds), while snow leopards are the smallest, with males weighing
              up to 75 kilograms (165 pounds). In addition to their size, big
              cats are known for their strength, agility, and sharp teeth and
              claws, which they use to hunt large prey. They are also solitary
              hunters, with the exception of lions, which live in social groups
              called prides.
